# Check In App âœ…

A hobby project consisting of a generic application where users can be created and checked in to a list, so other users know they are checked in.
An example of usecase would be a climbing gym, where climbers let other climbers know they are there having a climbing session (or just a cup of coffee/tee and a banana).
